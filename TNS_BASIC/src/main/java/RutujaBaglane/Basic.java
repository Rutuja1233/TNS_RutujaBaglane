		integer: Represents a range of whole numbers. -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
		Char: a range of 0 to 255.
		Double:  to 64 bits, after the decimal point.
		Unsigned int but not negative values.
		Float:a range of 1 to 126.
		Short int: Smaller than an int, with a range of -32,768 to 32,767.
		Long: Stores large integers, with a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. It takes more memory than an int, but gives a wider range of values.
		Unsigned long: A variation of long, with a range of 0 to 4,294,967,295
